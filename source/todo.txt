        *  summarize program's purpose/features
        *  summarize program's design

Finish Coding main features:
    -  add priority to money_alloc_data <--------
    
    -  Add ability to specify the length of time a budget spans (x number of days/months) and
        allow the user to pick the "currently active" budget

            * mabey make it so that the user can't create a budget that starts
                during a budget's "lifetime"
            * add control for user so they can choose the currently "active" budget
